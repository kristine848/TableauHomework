# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics - Analysis

Data and cleaning:

I pulled files from October 2019 - March 2020. In python I imported all six files and concatenated them into one data set to be pulled into Tableau. 

Visualizations:

Total Number of Trips - This is just a brief table that shows the total number of trips in the data set broken out by month. 

Station Map - This map shows the start stations for bikes. The markers and the colors are based on the number of records. It can also be played to show the changes as the months go by. 

Peak Winter Hours - This visualization shows what hours in the day have the most usage in the winter months. It is also broken down by age. 

Usage by gender - This graph shows number of trips by each gender taken by month. 

Bike Usage Duration/Gender - After converting the trip duration from seconds to minutes, I mapped out which bike IDs had the longest average trip duration. I also broke this down by gender

Customer Type by Gender - This shows if a customer is a yearly subscriber or just a customer (one to three-day pass). It breaks these catagories out by gender. 

Dashboard Usage - This dashboard usage would show the end user the peak hours of usage for the bikes in the winter average duration of the trip for each bike, and a map of the stations with the heaviest
usage. This would give the end user the ability to see which bikes might needs serviced next. Which stations need to be stocked with bikes and which you could pull bikes from based on location popularity. 
It will also tell the user what times of day the most bikes need to be available for customers. 

User Demographics Story - This story would tell the end user about the age and gender of their customers. I started by just pulling in the total number of rides by month. Then broke down 
the type of user by gender. Followed that with the gender usage by month to show the end user if there was a spike in female or male ridership. Then broke it down by age and gender so the 
end user could see what age groups to target marketing to. Lastly, I added the graph that would tell the end user which times of day are most popular for each age group to use the service. 


Data Trends Seen:

1. Usage in the winter months is heaviest during rush hours 8-9 AM in the morning and 4-5 PM at night. Users in the 30-40 age bin are have the biggest demographics. 

2. If any marketing was done to reach potential female customers during this time its effectiveness is not shown. The spikes in rides follow the same trends across all genders, and females ridership is significantly less. 

3. Also in regard to gender, the number of male and females that opt to purchase the one to three day customer pass is about even. However, the number of males that opt to become a yearly
subscriber greatly outweighs the number of females. 

4. Certain bikes are being used for longer trips. Based on this, creating a business plan to rotate which bikes are placed where when they have reached a certain trip duration might be helpful. 
For instance, if a bike has been used for several long duration trips at a high-volume station it could be rotated and placed at a lower volume station allowing that has shorter duration trips 
allowing for the bike to use for a longer period of time before being pulled out for maintenance.
